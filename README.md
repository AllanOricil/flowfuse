FlowFuse helps Node-RED developers deliver applications in a more reliable, collaborative and secure manner. Node-REDâ€™s intuitive, low-code development environment is great for connecting together hardware devices, APIs and online services. FlowFuse adds to Node-RED collaborative development, management of remote deployments, support for DevOps deliver pipelines, and the ability to host Node-RED applications on FlowFuse Cloud. FlowFuse is the devops platform for Node-RED application development and delivery.


## Key Features

* FlowFuse adds team collaboration to Node-RED, allowing multiple developers to work together on a single instance.
* Many organizations deploy Node-RED instances to remote servers or edge devices. FlowFuse automates this process by creating snapshots on Node-RED instances that can be deployed to multiple remote targets. 
* FlowFuse simplifies the software development lifecycle of Node-RED applications. You can now set up DevOps delivery pipelines to support development, test and production environments for Node-RED application delivery.
* FlowFuse is available from [FlowFuse Cloud](https://app.flowforge.com/account/create), a managed cloud service, or a self-hosted solution. 
* FlowFuse offers professional technical support for FlowFuse and Node-RED.
