This internal module can be used by tests to load resources from the core
code base without them needing to know their own position in the file-structure.

This makes it easier to move tests around with having to edit relative paths
from the test case to the src code.

Any file under the `test` directory of the repo can do:

```
// Load the test util module
const FF_UTIL = require('flowforge-test-utils')

// Load an arbitrary file from the src tree
const { Roles } = FF_UTIL.require('forge/lib/roles')
```

This module provides two functions

 - `require` - load a file from the source tree
 - `resolve` - get the full path to a file in the source tree
