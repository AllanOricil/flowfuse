# User management

## User registration

Depending on where FlowForge is installed, users should or should not be allowed 
to sign up to the service. User registration can be configured in the admin panel.
Go to "Admin Settings" > "Settings" and select or deselect "Allow new users to register on the login screen".

## Creating new users

To add new users to the platform go to "Admin Settings" > "Users" and click the
"New User" button. Fill out the form, and provide the new user with their password.

To require users to change their password the next time they log in, use the "Expire Password" option
on the "Edit User" dialog.

## Deleting a user

Users can only be removed if they don't own any teams and projects. As such the
user should delete any projects and ensure their teams have alternative owners. They
can either do this themselves or an Admin user can do it for them.

### Deleting your own account
If you are not the sole owner of a team and you are not the only admin, you can 
delete your own account from "User Settings"

### Deleting a user account
If the user is not the sole owner of a team and is not the last platform admin user,
an administrator can use the option in the "Edit User" dialog to delete the users account
