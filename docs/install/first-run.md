# First-run Setup

Following a successful install, you will be able to access the platform to go
through the initial setup.

By default, you can access the platform at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

##Â 1. Create an Administrator

The first user you create will be an Administrator. They will have full access
to the platform, be able to set platform-wide configuration and manage users and teams.

**Note**: with the 0.3 release, it is possible to reset your password *if* you have email
configured and enabled the `user:reset-password` option in Admin settings. Otherwise,
make sure you make a note of the password you set. We will provide tools to manage passwords
outside of the platform in a future release.

## 2. Upload a license

FlowForge Community Edition is Open Source and can be used freely without a license.

If you have a FlowForge Enterprise Edition license you can upload it here.

## 3. Platform Options

There are some runtime configuration options that can be configured at this stage.

### Anonymous usage statistics

To help us understand how the project is being used, we gather high level
anonymous usage information from running instances.

The Administrator can opt-out of this feature.

## Login

Once you complete the setup, you will be able to login as the Administrator user
you created in the first step.

## Next Steps

Once logged in, there are two remaining tasks the Administrator must complete
before projects can be created

### 1. Create a Project Stack

The Project Stack defines a set of platform configuration options that will get
applied to each project when it is created.

They are managed on the `Stacks` section of Admin Settings.

When creating a Stack, the options available will depend on which deployment
option is being used. For more information, refer to the documentation of your
chosen deployment model.


 - [Local Stacks](./local/stacks.md)
 - [Docker Stacks](./docker/stacks.md)
 - Kubernetes Stacks - *coming soon*

### 2. Create a Project Template

A Project Template provides a default set of Node-RED settings, such as the path
the editor is served from and whether users can install new nodes.

In 0.3, the template provides a minimal set of options, but this will be
expanded in future releases.
