# First-run Setup

Following a successful install, you will be able to access the platform to go
through the initial setup.

By default, you can access the platform at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

##Â 1. Create an Administrator

The first user you create will be an Administrator. They will have full access
to the platform, be able to set platform-wide configuration and manage users and teams.

**Note**: with the 0.1.0 release, it is *not* possible to reset this user's password
outside of the platform. Make sure you make a note of the password you set. We will
provide tools to manage passwords outside of the platform in a future release.

## 2. Upload a license

FlowForge Community Edition is Open Source and can be used freely without a license.

If you have a FlowForge Enterprise Edition license you can upload it here.

### Anonymous usage statistics

To help us understand how the project is being used, we plan to gather high level
anonymous usage information from running instances.

**This has not been implemented in the current release (0.1.0) - no data is gathered**

We will clearly communicate in future releases when this feature is implemented
and exactly what information is being gathered.

The Administrator can opt-out of this feature.

## Login

Once you complete the setup, you will be able to login as the Administrator user
you created in the first step.
