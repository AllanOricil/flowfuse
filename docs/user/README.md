## Projects

A team can own multiple projects, these help grouping logic and isolate them from
one and another. After creating an project within a team a Node-Red instance will
be attached to the project.

From within FlowForge users can start, stop, and restart a Node-Red instance.
Maintainance information like the logs are also available, as is an audit log.
